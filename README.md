## Description
Our site is a gacha game that lets users earn points by answering trivia questions correctly. They can select a level of difficulty and a category for their trivia questions, and if they answer a question correctly, they will earn a point. If they answer a question incorrectly, they will receive an evil insult generated by an API. After they collect 10 points, they will be able to open a card pack and get random cards. Each card will have a cat picture and a piece of advice, which are both generated by APIs.
